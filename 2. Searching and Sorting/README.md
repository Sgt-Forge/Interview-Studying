# Searching
Searching algorithms is a great way to practice your coding skills and help you learn about algorithms.  There exists many different searching algorithms, and all algorithms have specific use cases that make them better than others in certain use cases.  

We'll start with some terminology and graph theory to refresh your memory about graphs.  The refresher will get you up to speed for an interview if you're familiar with the content, but you should use the references and your *GoogleFu* to get a rock solid understanding of graph theory and the algorithms.

- Thoughts for myself
    - Go into why runtimes often include both `|E|` and `|V|`
    - I forgot the nuance about that until watching the MIT OpenCourseWare on Dijkstra's algorithm
    - You loop through all edges when adding them to the frontier
        - So even though you don't explicitly represent the Edges, you still loop through them as if they are actual objects
